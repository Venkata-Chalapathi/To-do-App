# ✅ To-Do List App

A simple and clean **To-Do App** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — because every great developer journey starts with managing tasks the dev way!

## 🚀 What’s Inside?
- Add tasks as they pop into your mind 💡
- Mark them complete like a boss ✔️
- Remove them when you’re done decluttering 🗑️

## 🎯 What I Learned
This project wasn’t just about building a to-do list — it taught me the **real power of JavaScript**.  
The highlight? Learning how to use **event listeners** to make the app interactive and dynamic.

🧠 Key Concepts I Practiced:
- JavaScript **event handling**
- DOM manipulation
- Updating UI in real time

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## 🌱 Why This Matters
This project helped me understand how small actions like **clicks, keypresses, and events** shape the entire user experience.  
It’s a small project — but a big step in my JavaScript learning journey.
